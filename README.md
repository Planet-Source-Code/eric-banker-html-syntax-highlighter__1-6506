## Html Syntax Highlighter


</div>

### Description

This code shows users how to perform Syntax Highlighting on HTML files. This includes highlighting when the file is opened, as the user types, as tags are inserted, and maintains coloring as the cursor is moved in and out of tags with the mouse or keyboard. This is a full application that demonstrates every possible function of the code and also shows how to perform editor functions and implement unlimited undo/redo.
